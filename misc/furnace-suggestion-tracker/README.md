Some prototypes for a repo-based "suggestion" tracker.

There's a [CSV-based one](suggestions.csv) (can be edited in a
spreadsheet program) and a [markdown
one](suggestions.md) (which I think is pretty nice because it's direct).

And last of all, there's a [HTML+JS](suggestions.html) version, which I
think is cooler because we can do some special filtering code (sort by
stars etc.) and make the page look nice. But whether that much is even
needed is something I don't quite know how to answer.
