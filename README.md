# snippets

A repository with random small projects I felt like making public. Most of them are simple experiments, others are proofs-of-concept.

Repo structure:

- `by_lang/` is a folder with some code organized by language. I used to
    do that before, might move them out later.

- The other folders and files are self-contained projects. Every project
    that needs more than one file should be a folder (with said files
    inside).

  To build a project, look for a `Makefile`, a `CMakeLists.txt` or a
  related build file in there.

Related repositories:

- [experiments-rp2040](https://github.com/yohannd1/experiments-rp2040):
  experiments with the BitDogLab board and its RP2040 microcontroller.

- [compscripts](https://github.com/yohannd1/compscripts): small compiled
  utilities I make. Planning on moving them away from there.

Just a repository I made with a bunch of random code snippets.

The files are stored in folders based on their languages (or other
filetypes), and they are mostly independent, but sometimes they might
interact with other files.
