# mandelbrot_sdl

A cpu-based renderer for the Mandelbrot Set, using C and SDL.

Originally based on code given by [Magoninho](https://github.com/Magoninho).

Back when I made this I didn't quite understand what was going on, and
now (as of 2025) I still don't lol. I want to touch this again someday,
though, probably doing direct GPU rendering.
